\f0\fs36 \cf0 This read me will be short and to the point. This script requires Python 2.5+ and is incompatible with Python 3. The script also runs on Selenium which can be downloaded from their website. I will not be working on this project any longer and currently, as it stands, the script works about 70% of the time with my account. I have not tried other accounts and will not attempt to. As always, be careful when running the script as it requires your username and password for gmail and steam. I wish you all good luck in your future steam gifts endeavors.}
